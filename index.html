      <p>
        Welcome to Sloth Yoga studio, opened specifically for children. Based in
        Castleknock, Dublin we are never too far away. The idea about yoga studio for kids was born after our son was struggling to regulate his emotions, therefore getting upset and angry very often. With my yoga and an exercise knowledge, we started a fun and exiting journey of helping many more. We are passionate about
        yoga and benefits it gives to not only adults but children alike. It is
        our goal to provide fun enviroment for children to explore yoga through
        playful and engaging classes while building flexibility, strength and
        mindfulness. Our core belief is that starting yoga practise early builds
        self-confidence, helps to manage stress and stay focused on daily basis.
        Our mission is to empower children to lead healthy and balanced lives
        through the practice of yoga. We provide everything needed for our yoga
        classes, so it is as easy as come and join the fun!
