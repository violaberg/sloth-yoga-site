    <p id="benefits">
        It's no secret yoga is highly beneficial for kids as much as it is for adults. Overall yoga offers wide range of benefits for kids, let's have a look at the biggest rewards.

    <ul class="benefits-list">
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Improves self-control
            <p>
            Self-control is a crucial part of a child's development. Children with good self-control do better at maintaining
            friendships, making decisions, and respond calmer to stressful situations. Those practising yoga become more patient and calm.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Reduces stress and anxiety
            <p>
            Very often adults think kids have nothing to stress about but that is not entirelly right. Everyday life is becoming
            more and more stressful for kids and while many things might be silly to adults, it's not so for them. They need
            de-stress tools as we all! Yoga is a fantastic way for kids to work through their complicated feelings and keep nervous
            system healthy for years to come.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Improves focus and attention span
            <p>
            Concentration is one of the hardest skills for kids to master! All kids needs freedom to explore but it is equally
            important to teach them to maintain focus and attention span to learn new things and build relationship with others. Yoga motivates to concentrate on one task at a time which in return teaches to maintain focus for a longer time.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Helps with fine and gross motor skills
            <p>
            We all know how wobbly can be a child, after all they learn everything from beginning, we all started there. Like any
            other sports, yoga aids kids to train their balance, hand-eye coordination, and other main movements with small muscles.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Builds strength and improves flexibility
            <p>
            Strength and Flexibility probably comes to mind most often when one thinks of physical activity and being consistent at
            yoga increases flexibility and grows lean muscle that in return keeps kids safe during other activities.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Helps with emotion regulation
            <p>
            The very basis of yoga is to find a balance between the mind and the body. We as humans, and especially kids, go through
            a big range of emotions every day, yoga helps to regulate different emotions and learn have to stay calm when needed.
            The American Journal of Occupational Therapy study discovered that daily yoga can help children with autism (ASD) to
            remain calm and lower levels of aggression, social withdrawal or anxiety. In fact, yoga is very effective during
            emotional teenage years as kids go through acceptance of change of their body and navigate hormonal changes.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Improves overall health
            <p>
            Children spend more time sitting on daily basis than they ever did before, very often muscles become tense and yoga can
            certainly help. Stretching itself relieves tense muscles regularly and yoga has many stretching and bending poses. It
            can help with digestion and find relief in constipation, improve immunity, decrease asthma symptoms, decrease stomach pain for those suffering with IBS and regulate
            hormones, blood sugar and insulin levels.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Builds confidence
            <p>
            One of the biggest benefits in our opinion is that yoga helps children develop a healthy relationship with their body,
            which is such an important and healthy mindset for life but aids when going through teenage years as well. Regular yoga
            practise teaches them to believe in their capabilities as they learn more moves/poses and become proud of their
            achievements.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Refines coordination and body awareness
            <p>
            Most of the times yoga studios don't have mirrors so one practising can focus on body's present ability and how pose
            feels rather than how it looks. Regular practise helps to develop strong mind and body.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile-beam" style="color: #007791;"></i>Improves sleep
            <p>
            Sleep is incredible part of child's developement. It is just as crucial as healthy nutrition and physical activities.
            Practising yoga daily can help to relax and prepare for a good night sleep. There is no need for a full hour yoga either, just
            few minutes of breathing to calm the mind and body will make night time routine much easier.
